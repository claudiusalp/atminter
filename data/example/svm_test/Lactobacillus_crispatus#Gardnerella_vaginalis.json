{"SUMMARY": {"INT": "1", "POS": "0", "NEG": "1"}, "PAPERS": [{"PMID": "24805362", "TI": "lactobacillus crispatus dominant vaginal microbiome is associated with inhibitory activity of female genital tract secretions against escherichia coli.", "TIHT": [], "AB": "objective: female genital tract secretions inhibit e. coli ex vivo and the activity may prevent colonization and provide a biomarker of a healthy microbiome. we hypothesized that high e. coli inhibitory activity would be associated with a lactobacillus crispatus and/or jensenii dominant microbiome and differ from that of women with low inhibitory activity. study design: vaginal swab cell pellets from 20 samples previously obtained in a cross-sectional study  of near-term pregnant and non-pregnant healthy women were selected based on having high (>90% inhibition) or low (<20% inhibition) anti-e. coli activity. the v6 region of the 16s ribosomal rna gene was amplified and sequenced using the illumina hiseq 2000 platform. filtered culture supernatants from lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus iners, and gardnerella vaginalis were also assayed for e. coli inhibitory activity. results: sixteen samples (10 with high and 6 with low activity) yielded evaluable microbiome data. there was no difference in the predominant microbiome species in pregnant compared to non-pregnant women (n = 8  each). however, there were significant differences between women with high compared to low e. coli inhibitory activity. high activity was associated with a  predominance of l. crispatus (p<0.007) and culture supernatants from l. crispatus exhibited greater e. coli inhibitory activity compared to supernatants obtained from l. iners or g. vaginalis. notably, the e. coli inhibitory activity varied among different strains of l. crispatus. conclusion: microbiome communities with  abundant l. crispatus likely contribute to the e. coli inhibitory activity of vaginal secretions and efforts to promote this environment may prevent e. coli colonization and related sequelae including preterm birth.", "ABHT": "1"}, {"PMID": "22539000", "TI": "characteristics of lactobacillus and gardnerella vaginalis from women with or without bacterial vaginosis and their relationships in gnotobiotic mice.", "TIHT": [], "AB": "the objectives of the present study were to evaluate in vitro the production of antagonistic compounds against gardnerella vaginalis by lactobacillus strains isolated from women with or without bacterial vaginosis (bv), and to select one of the better lactobacillus producers of such a substance to be tested in vivo using a gnotobiotic animal model challenged with one of the more sensitive g. vaginalis isolates. a total of 24 isolates from women with and without bv were identified as g. vaginalis. a higher frequency (p<0.05) of this bacterium was observed in women with bv (56.7%) when compared to healthy women (17.6%). a total of 86 strains of lactobacillus were obtained from healthy women and women with bv. lactobacillus strains were more frequently present (p<0.05) in healthy women  (97.5%) than in women with bv (76.7%). lactobacillus crispatus was the predominating strain in both healthy women and women with bv. lactobacillus jensenii, lactobacillus johnsonii, lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus vaginalis were isolated with an intermediate frequency in the two groups. in vitro antagonism assays were performed using as indicators 17 reference strains and the g. vaginalis strains isolated from women with bv and from healthy women.  lactobacillus isolated from healthy women showed the higher antagonistic activity against all the indicator strains when compared with isolates from women with bv. concerning the indicator strains, g. vaginalis found in women with bv was more resistant to the antagonism, particularly when lactobacillus isolates from women  with bv were used as producer strains. a high vaginal population level of g. vaginalis was obtained by intravaginal inoculation of germ-free mice, and this colonization was accompanied by vaginal histopathological lesions. a tenfold decrease in vaginal population level of g. vaginalis and a reduction of histological lesions were observed when the pathogenic challenge was performed in mice previously monoassociated with an l. johnsonii strain. concluding, results of the present study suggest that progression of g. vaginalis-associated bv depends in part on a simultaneous presence of lactobacillus populations with a low antagonistic capacity and of a g. vaginalis strain with a high resistance to  this antagonism. the results could also explain why g. vaginalis is frequently found in the vaginal ecosystem of healthy women.", "ABHT": "1"}, {"PMID": "19951608", "TI": "comparison of main lactobacillus species between healthy women and women with bacterial vaginosis.", "TIHT": [], "AB": "background: the normal microbial flora of the vagina plays an important role in preventing genital and urinary tract infections in women. thus an accurate understanding of the composition and ecology of the ecosystem is important to understanding the etiology of these diseases. this study aimed to compare the characteristics of main lactobacillus species between healthy women and women with bacterial vaginosis (bv) by quantitative culture and pcr methods. main lactobacillus species include l. crispatus, l. gasseri, l. jensenii and l. iners. methods: a total of 150 women attending gynecology outpatient clinic of beijing friendship hospital, were diagnosed as having bv because three or more of the following criteria were met (standard of amsel's composite criteria): homogeneous discharge, elevated vaginal ph (ph > 4.5), production of amines, and presence of  \"clue\" cells. those with less than three of the criteria were considered as healthy. simultaneously, smears were made of vaginal fluid and gram stained, then were assessed qualitatively as normal (grade i), intermediate (grade ii), or consistent with bv (grade iii). gardnerella vaginalis were identified by using vitek 2 compact and pcr methods. lactobacillus species were identified by pcr methods. gardnerella vaginalis and lactobacilli colony counts were determined by  calculating the most number of colonies of each species in the appropriate plates (colonies between 10 and 300), corrected by the dilution of the sample in the plates, and multiplied by 10 (to account for plating 100 microl), in order to get colony forming units per milliliter of vaginal secretion. results: bv was diagnosed in 31% (46/150) patients using the composite criteria, the remainder being regarded as healthy. the majority of patients with bv had a smear assessed  as grade iii (91%, 42/46) and minority of them had a smear assessed as grade ii (9%, 4/46). the majority of healthy women had a smear assessed as grade i (64%, 67/104). smears assessed as grade ii were found (36%, 37/104) among patients diagnosed as healthy, with less than three of the composite criteria. l. crispatus was cultured from 94% of healthy women and 83% of women with bv, with the former colonies count average value of 10(6) and the latter of 10(3). l. gasseri, l. iners, and l. jensenii were cultured from 85%, 68% and 43% of healthy women; and 28%, 89% and 44% of bv women, respectively. conclusions: the quantities of four lactobacillus species except l. jensenii had a significant difference between healthy women and women with bv. our results provide support for the negative association between l. iners and l. gasseri. although l. crispatus were existent both in healthy and bv positive women's vagina, the numbers of l. crispatus were significantly different for the dominant number in healthy women. smears of vaginal fluid and gram stain play an important guiding role in bacteria culture.", "ABHT": "1"}, {"PMID": "17234391", "TI": "effect of lactobacillus challenge on gardnerella vaginalis biofilms.", "TIHT": [], "AB": "bacterial vaginosis (bv) is the most common infectious condition in women. it is  caused primarily by anaerobic bacteria which rapidly form biofilms recalcitrant to antibiotic treatment, elevate vaginal ph, induce inflammatory processes and displace indigenous lactobacilli from the vault. gardnerella vaginalis is commonly associated with these infections. microscopy analysis showed that within 72 h, viable g. vaginalis covered a surface area of 567 microm(2), reached a depth of 16 microm and a density of approximately 104 microm(3). they maintained  these levels for a further 3 days unless challenged with lactobacilli strains. lactobacillus reuteri rc-14 produced the biggest displacement of gardnerella. this was not due to ph, which remained between 4.7 and 5.1 for all experiments, nor by hydrogen peroxide which is produced in low amounts by strain l. reuteri rc-14, high amounts by l. crispatus 33820 and not at all by l. rhamnosus gr-1. deconvolution microscopy showed changes in structure and viability of the biofilms, with loss of dense gardnerella biofilm pods. for the first time, a strain of l. iners, the most commonly isolated vaginal lactobacillus in healthy women, was tested for potential probiotic properties. it was found to disrupt gardnerella biofilm surface area, density and depth, albeit to a lesser extent than l. reuteri rc-14. these studies help to provide insight into the clinical situation in which probiotic and indigenous vaginal lactobacilli can interfere with gardnerella's presence and reduce the risk of bacterial vaginosis.", "ABHT": "1"}, {"PMID": "17059467", "TI": "lactobacillus strains isolated from the vaginal microbiota of healthy women inhibit prevotella bivia and gardnerella vaginalis in coculture and

crispatus inhibit the vaginosis-associated pathogens gardnerella vaginalis and prevotella bivia. results show that all the strains in coculture condition reduced the viability of g. vaginalis and p.

culture supernatant (cfcs) results in the killing of the pathogens that are adhering to the cells. the mechanism of the killing activity is not attributable to low ph and the presence of lactic acid alone, but rather to the presence of hydrogen peroxide and proteolytic enzyme-resistant compound(s) present in the cfcss. in addition, coculture of g. vaginalis or p. bivia with l.  gasseri ks120.1

producing inhibitory compounds against vaginal pathogens.", "TIHT": [], "AB": "two strains of lactobacillus crispatus (15l08 and 21l07) and one strain of lactobacillus jensenii (5l08) were selected from amongst 100 isolates from the vaginas of healthy premenopausal women for properties relevant to mucosal colonization and the production of h2o2 and/or bacteriocin-like compound. all three strains self-aggregated and adhered to vaginal epithelial cells, displacing well-known vaginal pathogens, such as gardnerella vaginalis and candida albicans. lactobacillus crispatus 15l08 was characterized as a potential h2o2 producer. a high level of bacteriocin-like compound was synthesized by l. jensenii 5l08, with a bactericidal mode of action for g. vaginalis, c. albicans and escherichia coli. however, h2o2-dependent activity alone was not sufficient to inhibit the growth of c. albicans. simultaneous actions of h2o2 and bacteriocin-like compound produced by lactobacilli may be important for antagonizing pathogenic bacteria. these strains of lactobacilli may be excellent candidates for eventual use as probiotics to restore the normal microbial communities in the vaginal ecosystem.",

select endogenous human vaginal lactobacilli strains on the basis of the main probiotic properties observed in the vaginal environment in order to use them for the evaluation of the potential prebiotic properties of oligosaccharides. from vaginal samples of 50 women with a normal flora, 17 lactobacilli strains were first isolated because of their high level of hydrogen peroxide production. then six strains were selected mainly for their ability (i) to adhere to vaginal cells, (ii) to produce compounds in sufficient amount, such as lactic acid, having an inhibitory action on pathogens, and less importantly, (iii) to demonstrate arginine deiminase activity. these six strains  were found to belong to three distinct species: lactobacillus crispatus, l. jensenii and l. vaginalis. one strain of each species was chosen as a potential vaginal probiotic strain with regard to our criteria. these three strains were then used to evaluate the prebiotic properties of different oligosaccharide series: two fructooligosaccharide series (fos actilight and fos raftilose) and two glucooligosaccharide series varying by their osidic linkages (alpha-1,6/alpha-1,4 gos and alpha-1,2/alpha-1,6/alpha-1,4 gos). the test was based on the ability of the oligosaccharides to promote the growth of the three beneficial strains selected but not of pathogenic microorganisms often encountered in urogenital infections such as candida albicans, escherichia coli and gardnerella vaginalis. oligosaccharide hydrolysis was followed by hplc analysis. this revealed that two oligosaccharide series (fos actilight dp3 and all alpha-1,6/alpha-1,4 gos dp > or = 4) were used only by the lactobacilli strains, the pathogenic microorganisms being unable to metabolise them. the selected lactobacilli and oligosaccharides are good candidates for incorporation  in a formula to prevent vaginal infections.", "ABHT": "1"}, {"PMID": "10847208", "TI": "characterisation and selection

lactobacillus for potential use as a probiotic in regenerating the vaginal flora  of women with recurrent episodes of bacterial vaginosis (bv). bv is a condition characterised by a depletion of vaginal lactobacilli accompanied by an overgrowth of a mixed vaginal flora of aerobic, anaerobic and micro-aerophilic species in very large numbers. bv has been associated with various gynaecological and obstetric complications and has an extremely high recurrence rate, due in part to the failure to establish a normal vaginal flora after antimicrobial therapy. a total of 60 vaginal isolates of lactobacilli was assessed for characteristics considered important for vaginal re-colonisation. the characteristics studied were the in-vitro inhibitory activity of the lactobacilli against bacterial species isolated from women with recurrent bv, acid production after growth of the lactobacilli in liquid culture, production of hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) and adhesiveness of the lactobacilli to exfoliated vaginal epithelial cells (vec). four strains of lactobacilli, l. acidophilus (61701 and 61880), l. crispatus (55730) and l. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii (65407), demonstrated the greatest  inhibitory activity against the bv-associated bacterial species. two of these isolates (55730 and 61880) produced h2o2. all four isolates produced a highly acidic environment after growth in liquid medium (ph <4). only one of these (strain 61701) was strongly adherent to vec (>100 bacteria/vec). a further isolate (l. acidophilus 48101) did not demonstrate maximum inhibitory activity against bv-associated bacteria, but was found to be a strong producer of h2o2 and was also highly adherent to vec. isolates 61701 and 48101 could be candidates for use as probiotics for vaginal re-colonisation.", "ABHT": "1"}, {"PMID": "10496892", "TI": "acid production by vaginal flora in vitro is consistent with the rate and extent  of vaginal acidification.", "TIHT": [], "AB": "perinatally, and between menarche and menopause, increased levels of estrogen cause large amounts of glycogen to be deposited in the vaginal epithelium. during these times, the anaerobic metabolism of the glycogen, by the epithelial cells themselves and/or by vaginal flora, causes the vagina to become acidic (ph approximately 4). this study was designed to test whether the characteristics of  acid production by vaginal flora in vitro can account for vaginal acidity. eight  vaginal lactobacillus isolates from four species-l. gasseri, l. vaginalis, l. crispatus, and l. jensenii-acidified their growth medium to an asymptotic ph (3.2 to 4.8) that matches the range seen in the lactobacillus-dominated human vagina (ph 3.6 to 4.5 in most women) (b. andersch, l. forssman, k. lincoln, and p. torstensson, gynecol. obstet. investig. 21:19-25, 1986; l. cohen, br. j. vener. dis. 45:241-246, 1969; j. paavonen, scand. j. infect. dis. suppl. 40:31-35, 1983; c. tevi-benissan, l. belec, m. levy, v. schneider-fauveau, a. si mohamed, m.-c. hallouin, m. matta, and g. gresenguet, clin. diagn. lab. immunol. 4:367-374, 1997). during exponential growth, all of these lactobacillus species acidified their growth medium at rates on the order of 10(6) protons/bacterium/s. such rates, combined with an estimate of the total number of lactobacilli in the vagina, suggest that vaginal lactobacilli could reacidify the vagina at the rate  observed postcoitally following neutralization by the male ejaculate (w. h. masters and v. e. johnson, human sexual response, p. 93, 1966). during bacterial  vaginosis (bv), there is a loss of vaginal acidity, and the vaginal ph rises to >4.5. this correlates with a loss of lactobacilli and an overgrowth of diverse bacteria. three bv-associated bacteria, gardnerella vaginalis, prevotella bivia,  and peptostreptococcus anaerobius, acidified their growth medium to an asymptotic ph (4.7 to 6.0) consistent with the characteristic elevated vaginal ph associated with bv. together, these observations are consistent with vaginal flora, rather than epithelial cells, playing a primary role in creating the acidity of the vagina.", "ABHT": "1"}]}
